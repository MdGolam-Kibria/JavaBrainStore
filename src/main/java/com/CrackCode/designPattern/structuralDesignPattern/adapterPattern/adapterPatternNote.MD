 As name suggests adapter pattern is used adapt two different incompatible system.

 Adapter pattern also helps and be connector between your system and some third party or legacy system.
 For example your system expects data in one format to process and third party sends in one format.
 Example : Consider you have to invoke some third party soap service which is xml base however your system is built on JSON
 with some advanced fields at that time you create JSON-to-XML adapter which will help to interact with thirdparty.
 

Adapter pattern can be achieved in two ways :
 1. Class Level: class level mean to adapt something you are extending and doing inheritance of that class.
 2. Object level : Object level mean you keep has-a relationship with class rather doing tight coupling in system.

 One of the example is we know java supports both array and list to store data. Now you have legacy system
 which is using array and you want to use collection functionalities to do so we have to convert, so Arrays.asList work as adaper
 between array to list and then use collections.

 A java.io.InputStreamReader translates a byte stream into a character stream, and a java.io.OutputStreamWriter translates a character stream into a byte stream. These classes exemplify the Adapter pattern.
 In particular, they change input/output stream interfaces to the required reader/writer interfaces

**MY EXAMPLE :** 

 In this example we will see that Swiggy is selling food app now suddenly lockdown arise
 and they thought to provide service of delivering grocery items for sometime so they write adapter which
 helps them to convert similar to food item without touching their food delivery business.
