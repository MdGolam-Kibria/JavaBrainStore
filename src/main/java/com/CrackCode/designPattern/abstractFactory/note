AbstractFactoryPattern:-

   AbstractFactoryPattern is a design pattern. AbstractFactoryPattern mainly factory of object.
   for implement this design pattern in our code make a interface or abstract class after that implement this class
   to needed class after that
   This pattern includes a generic interface to create
   there we will add a Factory class where we can
   add method which will return the instance/object ( this object must be  a child of the interface) of the class based
   on your requirement and this method will return

   Real life example :-

   if we talk with real life scenario about This pattern,
            2 or more  software industry after marge make a company Name called [BusinessAutomation] interested to add 2 or more developers and every developers will a child of this company
            if we get the programmerName based on programming language on this company
            we can achieved that using this design pattern.

            Example: see this current package code.
