#### **HashMap :**  <br/>

HashMap is a one type of collection in Java collection framework to store values in key and value pair.
HashMap uses hashing technique for storing values. HashMap uses internal data structure as array and LinkedList
for storing key and values. HashMap contains an array of nodes, and node presented by a class with respect to key.
