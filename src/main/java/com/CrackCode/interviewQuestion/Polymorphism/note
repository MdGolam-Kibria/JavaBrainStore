Question:- What is Polymorphism in java ? How can we achieve Polymorphism ?

Answer:-
Polymorphism means "many forms"
    This allows us to perform a single action in different ways from many position as we need for our requirement,
Polymorphism mainly two types :

1)Compile Time 2) Runtime

Compile Time :-
   If we talk about compile time Polymorphism there are  many ways to achieve compile time Polymorphism like below:

        1.different parameterized constructor(same constructor name but behaviour/result  different depend on  parameter )
.	    2.different parameterized Method(same method name but behaviour/result  different depend on  parameter and we can call
          a method from many positions as we need )
        3. We can also achieve Polymorphism by parent child relationship(we call in java inheritance).
        4. We can achieve Polymorphism by overloading functions or constructor by pushing the parm as we need results.



Runtime :-
		If we talk about Runtime Polymorphism there are  many ways to achieve runtime Polymorphism like below:-
1.by different parameterized method overriding we can achieve Runtime polymorphism.(Note : here Constructor overriding is not possible, Constructor depends on class name , Constructor looks like a method but name should be as class name and no return value  ).
			When we override a method of super class then create then output will be based on reference object for

example 1 :- See the example 1 package

Output: Sir Complete Your Requirements

Here program decided to call  the dowork() method runtime based on her reference object.

example  2: See the example 2 package
Output : Female

Here program decided to call  the dowork() method runtime based on her reference object.
