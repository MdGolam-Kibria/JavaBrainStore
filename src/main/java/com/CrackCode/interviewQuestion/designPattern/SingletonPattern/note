Question :-What is Singleton pattern in java ? Types of singleton ? and How can we achieve that ?
Answer:-
Singleton pattern is divided into two types
   1)Eager Loading: creation at load time.
   2)Lazy Loading: the creation of an object whenever needed. Both eager and lazy design patterns differ in the way of
   returning the object, if an object is null it returns a new singleton object or other particular objects.
